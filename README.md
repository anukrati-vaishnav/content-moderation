# content-moderation
This project focuses on leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing
(NLP) to detect and combat toxicity in online comments. By employing machine learning
techniques, the project aims to create an automated content moderation system that ensures safer
and more inclusive online spaces. The analysis is based on a dataset of user-generated comments
labeled with various toxicity attributes, such as toxic, severe toxic, insult, obscene, and others.
